/**
 * Checks if a temporary file is explicitly deleted or scheduled to be deleted
 * when the virtual machine terminates.
 *
 * The documents mentions how to utilize a temporary-file facility, as follows
 * (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/File.html#createTempFile%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.io.File%29):
 * <blockquote>
 * This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility. To arrange for
 * a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the
 * deleteOnExit() method. 
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * This specification assumes that a temporary file created by
 * createTempFile() is ephemeral and thus should be deleted either explicitly
 * by delete() or implicitly by deleteOnExit(). An execution that violates
 * this property is not necessarily faulty but may not be what the user
 * intended.
